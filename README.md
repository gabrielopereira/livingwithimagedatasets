# livingwithimagedatasets

This is the repository for the ["Images to live with" tool](https://learningfromlivingwithdata.herokuapp.com/).

The tool automatically picks from a selection of 14436 images randomly chosen from 8 different datasets: ("Tiny ImageNet", "COIL-100", "Labelled Faces in the Wild", "Leaf", "Open Image", "Stanford Dogs", "Tencent", and "VisualGenome"). It uses a simple Node.js server with the pdfkit library to generate PDFs containing the random images from datasets.

For more details on the process, read the article ["Living with images from large-scale data sets: A critical pedagogy for scaling down"](https://doi.org/10.1080/17540763.2023.2189285), on the Photographies journal.
