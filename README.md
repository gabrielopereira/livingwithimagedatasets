# livingwithimagedatasets

This is the repository for the ["Images to live with" tool](https://learningfromlivingwithdata.herokuapp.com/).

The tool automatically picks from a selection of 14436 images randomly chosen from 8 different datasets: ("Tiny ImageNet", "COIL-100", "Labelled Faces in the Wild", "Leaf", "Open Image", "Stanford Dogs", "Tencent", and "VisualGenome"). It uses a simple Node.js server with the pdfkit library to generate PDFs containing the random images from datasets.

For more details on the process, read the article ["Living with images from large-scale data sets: A critical pedagogy for scaling down"](https://doi.org/10.1080/17540763.2023.2189285), on the Photographies journal.

![With millions of images to pick from, it may be difficult to understand why this is my favorite image of a large-scale dataset (Figure 1). I get it, the photo is actually very uninteresting at first glance: a woman opens a door and finds someone. But I had to look at this image more than once. And doing so, an ambiguous universe rich in possi- bilities soon appeared, worthy of comparison with the game of mirrors painted by Diego Velázquez in 1656 (Las Meninas) – yes, I really believe that. The woman who opens the door finds a person taking a picture of her. Behind her, a mirror reflects him, but we cannot see his reflection in its entirety because her head covers his body. We only know of this man through his reflection in the mirror that is inside the room behind her. The lack of image resolution makes it all the more dubious, just like thick brushstrokes: is she smiling at the camera? I could continue speculating on the door in the background (or its reflection?). . . It seems to be closed, but could it be open in a different image?](https://learningfromlivingwithdata.herokuapp.com/fig2.png)
